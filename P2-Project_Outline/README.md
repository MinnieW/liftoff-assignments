## Submission Instructions

### Overview
 My project will allow users to budget for events in their life. As expenses are added users will be able to see how much of their budget is left and/or how much they've gone over for the event. They will also be able to share the event with other user(s) so that the other person can participate in the budget or just view their progress.

 I got the idea for this project as I was spending for the holidays. I was unsure how much I spent overall and if that was more than I cared to spend. This will be helpful not just for the holidays but celebratory events like birthdays and weddings.

 Share: Users will be able to share specific events with other user(s) allowing them read/write privelages.
